# Utilities

HiQ provides numerous custom selectors, mixins and utility classes to make styling your project easier and faster. See below for a complete reference.

## Custom Selectors

Behind-the-scenes, HiQ uses custom selectors, made possible by the [postcss-custom-selectors](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-selectors) plugin. If you use the HiQ source files with PostCSS, these are also available to you.

## Mixins

HiQ mixins are available for you to use if you use the source files with PostCSS. Most mixins are also available as classes. Keep in mind that you should typically only use HiQ utility classes if that utility will apply at all breakpoints.
