# Contributing

## Getting Started

```sh
npm install
```

## Commits

This project uses the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/). You can run `npm run commit` to use a CLI tool that will walk you through filling out the commit.

When you commit, your commit message will be validated and linting will be run.

## Deployment

When a PR is approved and merged into master, a build will be run through Travis CI, docs will be deployed through Github Pages, and a new package will be released through NPM.
